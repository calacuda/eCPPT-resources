# eCPPTv2 Study Resources:

This is a compilation of resources for studying for the eCPPTv2. Not all of the resources are explicitly for the eCPPT but they will be helpful anyway. If this grows too large, I may split this up into multiple files. 

the structure for the INE course can be found [here](ine-curriculum.md) in markdown format or on [their page](https://ine.com/learning/paths/penetration-testing-professional) 

## Write Ups:
A list of exam write ups. Could give clues to the structure of the exam, and what should focused on during studying.
